The Impact of Social Media on Movie Popularity

Abstract
For this project, I’m going to look into how social media activity impacts the success of a movie. People express their thoughts online, view trailers on YouTube, and discuss movies on Twitter. I want to know if this interaction increases the amount of money that movies earn at the box office. I will use data from YouTube and Twitter in addition to Box Office Revenue data to do this. My objective will be determining whether social media activity can forecast a film’s box office performance and helps studios’ to enhance their marketing plans.

1.Introduction
Movie advertisement has developed as a result of social media. Studios used to rely on magazine articles, posters, and TV commercials. These days, Twitter and YouTube are important marketing tools. People comment on trailers, use hashtags, and tweet about movies. But does a movie really make more money with all this internet activity?

In this study, I'll investigate the relationship between box office income and Twitter and YouTube activity. I'll look for answers to some of the following questions: Do YouTube trailer views, likes, and comments predict box office success? Do films with more Twitter mentions earn more money?

2.Data Collection and Preparation 
I will gather and compile information from many sources in order to complete this assignment. The Box Office Revenue Dataset, which contains details about films, their release dates, genres, budgets, and earnings, will be my primary dataset.

I will gather information from YouTube and Twitter in order to assess social media activity. These will be used to determine how many tweets there are about each film, what hashtags are used, and whether the tweets are positive or negative. Sentiment analysis will assist me in understanding the opinions people have on a film.

I'll gather information on YouTube's trailer views, likes, and comments. In order to determine whether the audience's response is mainly good or negative, I will also examine YouTube comments. After gathering all of this data, I'll clean it up by eliminating duplicates, dealing with missing numbers, and ensuring that everything is formatted correctly.

3.Methodology
In order to identify patterns in the data, I will first conduct exploratory data analysis. I'll make visualizations such as heatmaps and scatter plots to show how social media activity and box office receipts are related. I'll then use statistical analyses to measure the strength of these connections. To determine whether more social media use relates with higher income, I will be using correlation tests. The accuracy of my models will then be assessed using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R2 score.

4.Results and Discussions
I assume that after data analysis, films with more active YouTube and Twitter profiles do better at the box office. I think films with more positive comments and tweets will make more money. Additionally, I expect that successful films will be associated with trailers that receive more views, likes, and good comments on YouTube.

I'll also investigate if social media reflects the excitement already present or if it has a direct impact on the box office. For instance, is a movie more popular because of the social media hype or because people tweet about it more because they are already interested in it? 

5.Limitations
There are several restrictions on this project. First, not all movie-related tweets are helpful. Some may be jokes or spam that have no effect on a film's overall popularity. Additionally, I will just use data from Twitter and YouTube, even though Instagram and TikTok are also quite important for movie promotion. In the future, I might add these platforms to my dataset to complete the analysis.

Showing that social networking actually boosts movie grosses is another difficulty. It is not always the case that one directly influences the other, even if I find a major correlation. Future studies should investigate whether early social media engagement predicts next box office performance and how social media engagement changes over time. Considering these difficulties, I think this study will offer valuable insights about how social media affects the film business.

6.Conclusion
Although social media has developed into an effective marketing tool, its precise effect on the box office is still unclear. In this study, I'll examine the connection between movie success and Twitter and YouTube contribution. I expect to find a correlation between increased social media involvement and higher box office earnings.Film studios may enhance their marketing tactics and bring in more viewers by being aware of these trends. To fully examine social media's impact on the entertainment sector, additional research will be required as it develops.
